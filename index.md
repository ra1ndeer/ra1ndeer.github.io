Project Iceberg is what I call my personal blog. Here you can find posts on machine learning, deep learning, statistics and whatever else I feel like posting.

## About me
---
My name is Luís Franco. I hold a BSc in Engineering Physics from Instituto Superior Técnico, a faculty from the University of Lisbon, and I'm currently finishing my Master's degree in Applied Mathematics in that same institution. This blog exists because I needed to gather all my research notes, code and math snippets in a single place. And if I'm gathering all my notes and projects in a single spot, might as well make them public, someone might find what I post helpful.

If you want to get in touch, here's my email: luisbap1999@gmail.com

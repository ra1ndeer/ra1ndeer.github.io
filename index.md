Project Iceberg is what I call my personal blog. Here you can find posts on machine learning, deep learning, statistics and whatever else I feel like posting.

## About me
---
My name is Luís Franco. I hold a BSc in Engineering Physics from Instituto Superior Técnico, a faculty from the University of Lisbon, and I'm currently finishing my Master's degree in Applied Mathematics in that same institution. There are really only three things I deeply enjoy: math, heavy metal music and combat sports.
